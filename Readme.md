**Commands**
- space - start/stop 4D noise evolution
- enter - toggle phong/transparent rendering

**Description**

This is my 2009 C/C++/OpenGL Experiment 

It uses OpenGL 2.1 and is inspired to [**Render to 3D Texture**](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/SDK/10.5/opengl/samples.html#render_texture_3D) example of OpenGL NVidia SDK 10.5

I just added a recent Visual Studio 2017 project solution, changed GLUT with GLFW, and use my [**VirtualGizmo3D**](https://github.com/BrutPitt/virtualGizmo3D) 3D object manipulator/orienteering.

For now only a Windows VisualStudio project/solution is available, but the project is portable on other Operating Systems. Soon available (hope) also a CMake file.

To build is need **GLFW** Library, other tools ([glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net), [virtualGizmo](https://github.com/BrutPitt/virtualGizmo3D)) are included
